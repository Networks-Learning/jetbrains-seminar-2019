#  JetBrains seminar on learning with temporal point process

This is the material for the JetBrains seminar on learning with temporal point process, 2019.

## Requirements

  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Hawkes

Here, we model recurring user activities with the help of Hawkes Processes.

You will need to implement one function (`sampleHawkes`) in the file

control.

You will need to implement several functions in the file `opt_model.py`. The
README file inside the `redqueen` subfolder contains additional information.
